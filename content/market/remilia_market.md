The Collection will be hosted directly on our site, using OpenSea's existing NFT marketplace framework on the backend to handle transactions and hook it into the overall NFT marketplace; people will be able to buy our works directly and resell freely across various NFT markets as they wish.

Every artist will have their own page with a bio & cv link, galleries for current works for sale & sold works, and pages for individual series of works as well (series is something missing from existing private markets despite being the mode in which most contemporary artists, especially digital, tend to work).

Remilia Collective artists will present exclusively on our Collection. We may also host guest works. It will be tightly curated - Remilia Corp will control uploads/takedowns in collaboration with the artist; the artist will not upload anything themselves.
