Title: Dispatches
Order: 4
---

Dispatches are any NFT communications distributed to every Remilia Shareholder. Note that unlike [Art Drops](art_drops), holding more shares will not entitle a shareholder to more copies of any given dispatch - only one dispatch is provided to each walley that contains at least on or more Remilia Share.

## Dispatch Design

Dispatches are provided as highly diluted NFTs as an experiment in utilizing NFT air drops as a distribution platform. The format is open-ended, but examples include a simple letter intended to be read by all shareholders, to an art print, to the RemiZine(#remizine)

## Speculative Value

All Dispatches will be unique and minted only once, so it is plausible some Dispatches may achieve a high resale value in the collector's market, especially earlier Dispatches while the Remilia Share supply is low, however speculative value is not a primary concern in Dispatch production as it is for [Art Drops](art_drops).

## RemiZine

[RemiZine](../../projects/remizine) is the premiere Remilia Dispatch, consisting of a [electronic zine](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Ezine) collaborated on by Remilia Collective artists, as an outlet for experimental work and platform for collective collaboration. Issues are provided exclusively to Shareholders as NFT air drops - the first NFT Zine.
