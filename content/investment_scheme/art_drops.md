Remilia holds regular "Art Drop" lotteries for limited-series NFTs produced by Remilia Collective artists and collaborators. Each Remilia Share will act as one ticket for the random lottery, allowing shareholders with more shares to have more chances of winning the NFT.

## Art Drops Design

NFT Art Drops are intended to reward shareholders with valuable art, minted in a higher series than standard Market works, but still scarce enough to avoid dilution. For this reason, they are provided in a lottery system. 

From the Collective perspective, Art Drops serve as a more casual space for artist experimentation and a hotbed for collaborative works.

Remilia Corp will be directly involved with artist's in commission and curation of Art Drops, with a focus on long-term speculative value in the works cultivated.

### Art Drops Schedule

Drops schedule will be determined by Remilia Corp curators, as artist works are produced and commissioned, and collaborations are cultivated. Goal post is for a regular bi-monthly lottery. Providing shareholders with genuine value is a primary goal, so scarcity will be maintained for Artist's works.

### Art Drop Grades (Standard, Emerald, Jadeite)

Art Drops are separated into three distribution Grades of increasing rarity: Standard, Emerald and Jadeite. The higher grade Drops are provided as exclusive benefits to [higher tier shareholders](../remilia_shares/shareholder_tiers) to allow for lower production runs. 

Emerald and Jadeite Art Drops serve as higher scarcity platforms for our in-demand artists to produce commissioned works for shareholders without diluting their brand.

## Jade Cabbage NFT

The [Jade Cabbage NFT](projects/../../../projects/jade_cabbage) is the premiere Remilia Art Drop, consisting of an ultra-rare NFT series of one-of-a-kind 3D models produced by Remilia Corp itself. It is gifted to a single Emerald+ shareholder on a once a month basis as the only regular and fully unique Art Drop.
