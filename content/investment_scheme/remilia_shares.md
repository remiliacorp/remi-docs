Remilia Shares Token (RST) will be made available for sale to the public to provide exclusive access benefits and form a mechanism for investing in Remilia Corp as a whole.

RST primary function is acting as a distribution platform for RemCo artist NFTs, with a host of secondary benefits ordered by Shareholder tiers.

## RST Design

RST is sold as an NFT on the ETH chain that can be bought and re-sold freely. However, holding onto RST in a wallet will make it eligible for shareholder reward emissions such as NFT [Art Drops](shareholder_incentives/art_drops).

In [Quarter 3](../collective/roadmap), RST will be made divisible into [$REMI coin](remi_coin) at a pegged 1:1000 ratio, and vice versa.

## RST Supply

The total supply of RST will never exceed 15,000. 10,000 RST is scheduled to be minted and sold over the next 2 years, with 5,000 RST set aside in the Remilia Treasury, minted when needed to be distributed to founding member's of the collective, and as incentives for future collective members and artist collaborations.
