Remilia is first and foremost a private art gallery - Remilia Market - exclusively representing a unique collective of artists - The Remilia Collective - in the digital NFT space.

However Remilia is also intended as a wide-ranging platform for artistic experimentation, with a portion of revenue collected to fund projects adjacent to NFT Art. It intends to occupy an institutional role in producing a [collaborative abundance network](/collective/04-glossary).

Due to this, Remilia is introducing an investment scheme to allow investment in the Corp itself, and thereby the Collective as a whole.

## The Value Pyramid

Value derivation is designed in a deeply interconnected triangle between three financial vehicles: 

1) The Remilia Market, and the NFT art world value it entails for artists
2) The Remilia Share Token (RST), and the value of its NFT Art Drops, Dispatches and Remilia Access Benefits
3) The $REMI Coin, and its value in use in Remilia Projects

Each point of the triangle are tied together by either shared Artist Clout or interconvertibility, such that value introduced to one reflects in all.

Each aspect of value will be broken down in the following sections.
