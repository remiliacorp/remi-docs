---

In the spirit of collaboration, Remilia Corp will institute a Patron Fund from a portion of the revenue generated by Remilia Market sales. This will be used towards offering Remilia Grants and supporting Remilia Residencies.

Grant nominees will be determined by Remilia Corp curation on a monthly basis with winners voted on by shareholders using their Patron Fund Votes. 

<tip>Patron votes are not one per individual; higher tier shareholders hold more votes than lower tier shareholders.</tip>

## Remilia Grants

Grants are provided as a no-strings-attached payment of $1,000 taken directly from the Remilia Treasury to a single online poster/artist each month, voted on by Shareholders. They are intended to provide recognition for high quality posters and foster the spirit of collaborative networked abundance.

## Remilia of the Month

Shareholders can also vote for their favorite RemCo artist of the month. The artist will earn 1 Remilia Star which will be displayed on their artist page. 3 Stars are exchangeable for a Jade Cabbage from Remilia Treasury's private storage.
