Title: Dispatches
Order: 2
---

Dispatches are any NFT communications distributed to every Remilia Shareholder. Note that unlike [Art Drops](art_drops), holding more shares will not entitle a shareholder to more copies of any given dispatch - only one dispatch is provided to each walley that contains at least on or more Remilia Share.

Dispatches are provided as highly diluted NFTs as an experiment in utilizing NFT air drops as a distribution platform. The format is open-ended, but examples include a simple letter intended to be read by all shareholders, to an art print, to the RemiZine.

## RemiZine

The RemiZine will be a quarterly [electronic zine](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Ezine) collaborated on by Remilia Collective artists, as an outlet for experimental work and platform for collective collaboration. Issues will be provided exclusively to shareholders.

Each RemiZine issue will have a specific theme with unique art and writing contributed to it, and be presented in the format of a 3D render of a traditional double-binded magazine.

As far as we are aware, RemiZine is the first NFT zine. 

## Speculative Value

All Dispatches will be unique and minted only once, so it is plausible some Dispatches may achieve a high resale value in the collector's market, especially earlier Dispatches while the Remilia Share supply is low, and unique artist prints or RemiZine issues, however speculative value is not a primary concern in Dispatch production as it is for [Art Drops](art_drops).
