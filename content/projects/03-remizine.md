## RemiZine

The RemiZine will be a quarterly [electronic zine](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Ezine) collaborated on by Remilia Collective artists, as an outlet for experimental work and platform for collective collaboration. Issues will be provided exclusively to shareholders.

Each RemiZine issue will have a specific theme with unique art and writing contributed to it, and be presented in the format of a 3D render of a traditional double-binded magazine.

As far as we are aware, RemiZine is the first NFT zine.
