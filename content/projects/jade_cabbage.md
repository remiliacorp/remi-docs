### Cabbage Production

The Jade Cabbage's production was conceptualized by Remilia Corp founder, Donna Horashi, as a commentary on the fuzzy boundary of digital and physical art production and definition of non-fungibility, in communication with the process of real Jadeite Cabbages and its making sculpture out of limited, discarded material and adjacent with the Orientalism Positive attitude of Remilia. 

The process begins with a real cabbage obtained from the grocery, which is then scanned into a 3D model using an augmented reality camera with an AR app. A high resolution photograph taken of real Jade marble overlayed by hand to form a texture paralleling the cabbage-like coloring seen in in-real-life Jade Cabbages. The cabbage is then destroyed.
