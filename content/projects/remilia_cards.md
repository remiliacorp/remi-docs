Title: "Remilia Cards"
Order: 1
---

Ome Onno will produce a series of trading cards sold as collectable NFTs in a fictional card game inspired by Magic: The Gathering's game-breaking meta exploit community.

The cards in the game will feature monsters, items and traps. The monsters will all be some anthropomorphized to some form indicative of the female gender.

## Format

Format: Card name; Card category - subcategory; Meta rules; Description of play; Fluff quote; & Portrait

## Distribution

Each cards will be prepared in thematic sets of 15 in collaboration with a RemCo or Remi Friends artist, providing the set unique speculative value according to each collaborating artist.

The cards will be sold in an experimental financial minigame exploiting NFT technology in a fictional trading card economy. Cards will be distributed in common, uncommon, rare and ultra-rare volumes (60%, 30%, 8%, 2%) through weekly English-style auctions selling booster packs, with 3 cards in each pack with the cards unknown until the auction is completed and the pack is "opened". Unopened packs may be held and resold.

Each set of 15 will have 6-9 monster girl cards. If all monster girls in the set are collected and held in one wallet, a special prize monster girl "Queen" card, will be rewarded to the wallet in the form of an airdropped NFT. If all cards in the set are collected, a 3D sculpted "figurine" will be rewarded.

*Note: There will be a 5% reseller fee on resale of cards to tax an exploit where users may all share their cards to each other and farm the free reward drop.*

## Alternative Booster Packs

"Set Booster Packs" holding cards of only a specific set will be sold, but only during the period of which that set is "printing", and a new collaborative set has not been released; at which point that new set will be sold in the Set Booster Pack. In this way, after the initial round, collecting all the cards in an older set can only be achieved through trading, or increasingly diluted booster packs.

"Rare Booster Packs" will also be sold at a premium that feature lower distribution of common and higher distribution of uncommon, rare and ultra-rare cards (30%, 50%, 16%, 4%).

## Internal Rules

Author's note: 
``` players use a continuous resource form called 'agency,' starting out at X amount, which is decreased by the cards they have on the field, according to their agency costs. agency-generating cards exist, even those that do not have any agency cost of their own, nor are there limits on how many cards can be played per turn. The trick is that the effects on each card are so ridiculous that both indulgence -- trying to play as much as one can in a vain attempt to overwhelm -- and restraint -- being a little calculating faggot -- can be adequately punished by either player.

Of course, this is not a real game, it merely assumes the form of one, and agency as a term within game mechanics is ambiguous enough to denote both a cost and power resource; every piece on the field with agency ascribed to them directly is detrimental to the player's own agency, perfidious as the forces are they harness: a player's agency represents their resistance to hostile forces, and for each attack of influence (a monster or other source its power) on the player that would reduce their agency that turn below zero, points of damage are taken according to the amount of influence that surpassed it. if an X amount of damage is taken, the player loses the game.

Thus, by wielding powerful forces on the field, a player lowers their own agency and consequently puts themselves at greater risk.

Monsters, aside from having agency and influence, have resistance as a defense resource, which can be used to block another player's monsters in combat, same as mtg, attacking player selects monsters to attack with, defending player selects monsters to block those with, monsters deal damage to each other depending on influence and are removed from the game if resistance is exceeded, but excess influence from the attacker will always pass through the defending monster and attack the defending player. This is a brief summary of the imaginary fundamentals which allow me to think up a couple designs.

## Commentary

Here we achieve a blend of artificially scarce collectable & transparent gamification, with actual artistic interest as well as the complexity of long-term speculative value tied to artist's clout; while giving a space to explore Ome Onno's creative meditations on TCG meta.
