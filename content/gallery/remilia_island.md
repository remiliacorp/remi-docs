Remilia Gallery is designed to be expanded into a virtual social space by implementing proximity voice chat and global text chat features in an application with dedicated server hosting. This will serve as an accessible tool for casual group chatting, including virtual reality support, filling a contemporary gap for advanced "hangout rooms".

## Remilia Island

The server will exist as public instances of a single Virtual Island map inspired by Japan's Naoshima Island, featuring engaging digital land art and modernist architecture that invites exploration as well as chance social encounter.
Cosmetics will be purchasable with $REMI in the form of NFT fashion wearable by your in-game avatar.

## Remilia Lofts

Remilia Island will feature NFT-based digital property ownership in the form of private houses on the island which can be customized with owned NFT art. 

Remilia Lofts will exist as invite-only virtual lofts which can be host to private parties while showcasing owned NFT art, featuring all the same social features as the standard Remilia Island virtual hangout space.

All image, video and audio based NFT's on ERC-721 can be supported.
