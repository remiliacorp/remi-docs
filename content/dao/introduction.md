Remilia is first and foremost a private art gallery - Remilia Market - exclusively representing a unique collective of artists - The Remilia Collective - in the digital NFT space.

However Remilia is also intended as a wide-ranging platform for artistic experimentation, with a portion of revenue collected to fund projects adjacent to NFT Art. It intends to occupy an institutional role in producing a [collaborative abundance network](/collective/04-glossary).

Due to this, Remilia is introducing an investment scheme to allow investment in the Corp itself, and thereby the Collective as a whole.
