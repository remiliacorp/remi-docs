## The Value Pyramid

Value derivation is designed in a deeply interconnected triangle between three financial vehicles: 

1) The Remilia Market, and the NFT art world value it entails for artists
2) The Remilia Share Token (RST), and the value of its NFT Art Drops, Dispatches and Remilia Access Benefits
3) The $REMI Coin, and its value in use in Remilia Projects

Each point of the triangle are tied together by either shared Artist Clout or interconvertibility, such that value introduced to one reflects in all.
