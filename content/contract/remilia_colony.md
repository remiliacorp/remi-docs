With the Remilia Trust formation, the Remilia Co-op fund will be drained empty. On NG+, there will be no quarterly payouts; the fund will act as a full investment portfolio, primarily towards the goal of buying land and property for the Remilia Colony.

The Remilia Colony will identify a suitable low population, rural Japanese village located with views of both the mountains and the sea with homes for sale in the traditional Japanese architecture. Remilia Co-op funds will be used to buy up a colony of traditional Japanese houses, one for every Remilia Collective member, and following that, important village land and infrastructure, until the village is dominated and controlled by Remilia and her affiliates.

*Note: We will run a perpetual broth restaurant with one big vat in the back and wooden communal bench seating that sells bowls for 300 yen and the waitresses dress like shrine maidens, but if you join the Remilia Soup profit-sharing cooperative, membership dues only 3,000 yen a month, you get one bowl a day for free and access to monthly Remilia Raves, and a quarterly redistribution of profits. (NOTE: We also sell housebrewed sake, eggs from the chicken coop in the back, and clay dishware made by the waitresses.) It will be a franchise targeting rural Japan.*
