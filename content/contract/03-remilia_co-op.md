title: "Remilia Co-op Fund"
order: 3
---

Remilia Co-op is formed of 1 equal share provided to each artist in the Remilia Collective. The Co-op is an investment portfolio contributed to in all Collection sales. Quarterly, interest earnings will be redistributed to Co-op members equally.

The goal of the fund is two-fold: reach a point where members of the co-op can each have their livelihood supported by the Co-op fund to allow full-time focus on their work, and encourage a collaborative family, such that if one person comes up, we all do.

The Co-op will meet virtually once a quarter where Remilia Collection sales and portfolio performance will be reported and payouts distributed; Patron Fund distribution will be negotiated and voted on alongside shareholders, and for general transparency reports on direction of Remilia Corp, etc.

At this time, any Artists can sell out of the collective by exchanging their Co-op share in exchange for their lifetime contribution to the co-op (10% of NFT sales) minus lifetime co-op payouts; lifetime contribution resetting on the formation of the Remilia Trust.

### Note Remilia Co-Op Investment Scheme

The first year or so will not have interest redistribution and an increased RemCorp contribution (10% match = 20% of all NFT sales) to focus on building the fund; we will probably hold a high-risk crypto portfolio until a certain number is reached, and then progressively move the portfolio towards lower risk investments where interest can safely accumulate.

*(In lieu of interest payouts if crypto valuation increases make up the substantial portion of earnings, we can structure a pay out a percentage of YTD earnings up to a certain figure.)*

## Remilia Trust

The Remilia Trust will be initiated once the Remilia Co-op's fund hits a target number, at which point the Co-op fund will be re-organized into a series of equal, individual trusts for each member paying out interest monthly until death.

The Remilia Trust's target goal is to provide an ample salary (say, $100K annual) for every member of the Collective, maintained into perpetuity by investing into a conservative index fund and paying out interest (after a portion reinvested to meet inflation).
