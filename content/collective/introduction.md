### History

Remilia Collective was founded on 1/11/21 by Remilia Jackson, organizing a group of disparate net artists who shared a unified vision described in the [New Art Manifesto]. The motivation behind the collective's initialization was the opportunity identified in the burgeoning NFT art space to sidestep institutional barriers preventing outsider net artists from presenting their work. The co-operative fund DAO was conceptualized to commit to an expression of abundance and collaboration.

### Members



## Remilia is an Institution

Remilia Collective primarily intends to engage in the NFT art space, but we also aspire to be host a wide-ranging platform for artistic experimentation. To achieve this, a portion of revenue is collected from NFT art sales to fund Remilia projects adjacent to NFT Art, organized under the Remilia Corp entity. 

### Remilia Corp

Remilia Corp is an umbrella shell company, incorporated as an LLC, funded by a cut of revenue from NFT sales on the Remilia Market as per the Remilia Collective Contract. Remilia Corp funds will be utilized towards building out infrastructure and projects for Remilia Collective.

### Investment Scheme

Due to the expansion of Remilia Corp as more than just a Collective of NFT art work, Remilia is introducing an investment scheme to allow investment in the Corp itself, and to formalize the patron relationship by providing NFT artwork in turn to a dedicated audience of Remilia Shares Token shareholders.

### Remilia Market

Remilia Market is the private NFT art gallery exclusively dedicated to representing Remilia Collective's NFT artwork. 

Initially released as web-based gallery, the Market will also be expanding into a virtual gallery for curated shows and a space for opening parties, and other experiments in the intersection between 3D/VR and crypto-art.

### Remilia House

Remilia House is a digital webstore and outsourced production facility for physical products by Remilia Collective artists. Most goods in the store will be sold at-cost as this is to facilitate experiments in physical work, not intended for profit revenue.

Some Remilia House sub-projects will explore the intersection of physical production and NFTs.

### Remilia Projects

Various other projects by Remilia Collective artists funded by Remilia Corp will be held under the Remilia Projects banner. The flagship project is Remilia: The Card Game.
