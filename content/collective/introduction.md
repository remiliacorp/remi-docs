## Background

![Remilia Jackson, Remilia Collective Founder](2021-03-21-18-38-39.png)



### History

Remilia Collective was founded on 1/11/21 by Remilia Jackson, organizing a group of disparate net artists who shared a unified vision described in the [New Art Manifesto]. The motivation behind the collective's initialization was the opportunity identified in the burgeoning NFT art space to sidestep institutional barriers preventing outsider net artists from presenting their work. The co-operative fund DAO was conceptualized to commit to an expression of abundance and collaboration.

### Members

Full member list TBA.

## Remilia is an Institution

Remilia Collective primarily intends to engage in the NFT art space, but also aspires to be host a wide-ranging platform for artistic experimentation at the intersection of social and crypto technology. Remilia Corporation is formed as an umbrella company to develop the Remilia Collective vision.

### Remilia Corp

Remilia Corporation is formed as an umbrella company to build the infrastructure required to realize Remilia Collective's vision. Remilia Corp also intends to provide its development resources to artists to help realize software-based conceptual art, which in turn can be used as POC's for possible products & services.

### Remilia Collective 

Remilia Collective is organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, under a smart contract that ties a portion of each artist's NFT sales to a co-operative investment fund shared amongst all the artists, as well as a portion back to Remilia Corp as a agency fee to fund its operations and development.

#### Investment Scheme

Remilia Collective provides an investment scheme to the public in the form of Remilia NFT Shares. These shares provide exclusive rights to Remilia Collective services and events, as well as serve as tickets to regular lotteries of NFT art prepared by Remilia Collective.

#### Remilia Market

Remilia Market is the private NFT art gallery exclusively dedicated to representing Remilia Collective's NFT artwork. 

Initially released as web-based gallery, the Market will be expanding into a virtual gallery for curated shows and a space for opening parties, and other experiments in the intersection between 3D/VR and crypto-art.

#### Remilia House

Remilia House is an NFT book publishing house. Limited edition runs of books from selected writers will be published as tokens which can be bought, sold or burned to be redeemed for a physical copy of the book.

#### Remilia Shop

Remilia Shop is a digital webstore and outsourced production facility for physical products by Remilia Collective artists. Most goods in the store will be sold at-cost as this is to facilitate experiments in physical work, not intended for profit revenue.

Some Remilia Shop sub-projects will explore the intersection of physical production and NFTs.

#### Remilia Projects

Various other projects by Remilia Collective artists funded by Remilia Corp will be held under the Remilia Projects banner.
