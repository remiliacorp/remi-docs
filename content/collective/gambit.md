## Dispatch 0.1

We're on the cusp of the new mode; posting is the work -- When you post, your enter a lucid, ascetic state, a communion with the network. It's not just media produced in the dark room alone, one picture a day for a 100 days. A video worked on for a week, and uploaded modestly to your page, then linked desperately to anyone you meet. No, it's networked. Authorship died by being distributed.

Remilia is reclaiming what's ours. Posting IS contemporary art, possibly the only field left, it sucks we've been forced to think its cringe to consider it that, that we've been locked out of the art world and demoralized from production only b/c their taste is lagging too far behind and the barrier of entry requires so much mindnumbing grift to teach them it. Instead, we'll just force our way in by moving one step ahead of them. Art world adoption of NFT is inevitable due to the genuine provenance issues it solves.

Commodifiability of art isn't important for the cash, but the legitimacy the market provides it, enabling its appreciation and consumption. NFT widens the range of sellable "mediums" to the most abstracted possible. We will teach them to appreciate our body of works, as they are. The money is just a proxy for reach & appreciation.

How the real art world is, its stratified, institutional, bureacratic, careful and conservative -- they've completely lost relevance in commentary for the contemporary, the digital world is lost to them even as it takes over the real. All the real, true artists -- who live every aspect of their lives as "art" -- are completely demoralized from actually producing; but they do make it, every day, in everything they do, from any shitpost to any way they spend their day. The art world market (and its almost total death of critics) just has fallen too far behind to understand it and recognize it as such.

But NFT is inevitable to be adopted by the irl art world due to it fixing real issues of provenance and sale, so the NFT art world and irl art world will quickly get integrated. We're going to sidestep the irl art world, get clouted in NFT, so when the integration happens, we're sitting on top, and they'll be forced to accept our new mode of art, posting. That's the Remilia gambit.
