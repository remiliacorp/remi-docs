## Letter from Remilia Jackson

![](2021-03-21-22-50-49.png)

This generation is experiencing an abundance of online artists -- true artists, who live every aspect of their lives as art -- at the same time that they are demoralized from producing in any frame compatible with the art world; but they do make it, every day, in everything they do. They see the art world as stratified, institutional, bureacratic, careful and conservative -- they've lost relevance in commentary for the contemporary and no longer exist in a position as the upstream of culture; the digital world isn't understood by them even as it takes over the real.

Commodifiability of art isn't important for the money, but the legitimacy the market provides it, enabling its appreciation and consumption. Until an art can be rendered into institutional lens, it struggles to receive due appreciation.

NFT widens the range of sellable "mediums" to the most abstracted possible. Like Duchamp's signature on a readymade, the act of minting an NFT turns anything into work - now with no barrier to being shown as such in a gallery context. The NFT Art World is the first time in decades that the art world has been in a serious position of disruption. While it exists today as largely parallel to the "real" art world, I believe it's inevitable for NFT technology to be integrated due to fixing real issues of provenance. 

When this happens, we're sitting on a well-established model that can be accepted as the new form. We now have the power to teach the world to appreciate our body of works, as they are. That's the Remilia gambit. Remilia is reclaiming what's ours.
