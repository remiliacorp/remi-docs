Remilia is forming an art collective to force self-legitimization of contemporary digital art through the NFT ("non-fungible token") cryptoart world, an immature market we could easily move in on and establish a position for us that will force recognition when the IRL art world eventually follows.

Background: NFTs are basically blockchain tokens applied to any object that allow there to be clear one-of-a-kind ownership deeds with provenance & sale history publicly tracked. This solves certain problems the art market has with identifying provenance, currently relying on trust-based system of agents; it also solves the issue of "owning" mutable art such as digital images; as well as makes international art dealing, and money laundering, much easier. It's a given the art world will eventually adopt NFTs as a standard, and has already been making moves towards it.

The NFT market also has its own burgeoning art world, but it's a virgin field, currently dominated by technically competent but artistically defunct producers. I believe we can move in on the market as a collective & dominate it with real works.

This also opens the door for what we're all doing online to be recognized as art, as it really is, train the market to see it, to consume it as such, and allow us to be appropriately compensated (filthy rich). Remember, we're only the artists alive and practicing today.
