Remilia holds regular "Art Drop" lotteries for limited-series NFTs produced by Remilia Collective artists and collaborators. Each Remilia Share will act as one ticket for the random lottery, allowing shareholders with more shares to have more chances of winning the NFT.

Remilia Art Drops are intended to reward shareholders with valuable art, designed as a lottery to avoid dilution. This serves as a more casual space for artist experimentation and a hotbed for collaborative works.

## Art Drops Schedule

Drops schedule will be determined by Remilia Corp curators, as artist works are produced and commissioned, and collaborations are cultivated. Goal post is for a regular bi-monthly lottery. Providing shareholders with genuine value is a primary goal, so scarcity will be maintained for Artist's works, with an focus on long-term speculative value in commissions cultivated. 

## Premium Art Drops

Occasional unique works rated to especially low distribution counts will be lotteried at a premium only to [higher tiered shareholders](/shareholder_tiers).

## Jade Cabbage

The Jade Cabbage is a unique, ultra-rare NFT produced by Remilia Corp to be gifted to a single shareholder on a once a month basis.

The Jade Cabbage's production was conceptualized by Remilia Corp founder, Donna Horashi, as a commentary on the fuzzy boundary of digital and physical art production and definition of non-fungibility, in communication with the process of real Jadeite Cabbages and its making sculpture out of limited, discarded material and adjacent with the Orientalism Positive attitude of Remilia. The process begins with a real cabbage obtained from the grocery, which is then scanned into a 3D model using an augmented reality camera with an AR app. A high resolution photograph taken of real Jade marble overlayed by hand to form a texture paralleling the cabbage-like coloring seen in in-real-life Jade Cabbages. The cabbage is then destroyed.

The store of Jade Cabbages that ends up back in RemCorp through its shareholdings will be buyable for 3 Remilia Stars.

Given enough time, we will all own a Jade Cabbage.
